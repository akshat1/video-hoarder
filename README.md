# Video Hoarder

Video hoarder is a simple web-application front-end to youtube-dl, set up to download videos straight to your server instead of whatever machine you are currently using. Built by a data-hoarder for data-hoarders.

# Disclaimer

This project grew out of a weekend project, so at the moment things are not super polished. That being said, I will clean it up if we see any adoption.
