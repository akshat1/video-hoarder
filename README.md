# Video Hoarder

Video hoarder is a simple web-application front-end to youtube-dl, set up to download videos straight to your server instead of whatever machine you are currently using. Built by a data-hoarder for data-hoarders.

# Genesis

This project grew out of a weekend project, so at the moment things are not super polished. That being said, I will clean it up if we see any adoption.

Features:
- functional but retina burning UI (don't forget your safety squints).
- quick setup. Install youtube-dl, npm install this and go.

# Installation

There is a docker container in the works, but for the moment,

- clone this repo.
- npm install.
- [install youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)
- npm run start.
- visit http://localhost:4000
