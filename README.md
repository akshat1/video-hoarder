# Currently being re-written

I'm in the process of re-writing video hoarder, and the current master branch is not recommended for use as it's not actively maintained and has several dependency issues.

If you are a developer and interested in taking the in-progress version of video hoarder for a spin, look at the branch [task--rewrite](https://github.com/akshat1/video-hoarder/tree/task--rewrite).

# Video Hoarder

Video hoarder is a simple web-application front-end to youtube-dl, set up to download videos straight to your server instead of whatever machine you are currently using. Built _by_ a data-hoarder, _for_ data-hoarders.

Video Hoarder is meant to run on your home (or cloud) server, and be accessible from your phone as well as your computer. The design reflects this focus on mobile first usability.
