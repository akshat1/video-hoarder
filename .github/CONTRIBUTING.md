Thank you for considering contributing to Video Hoarder.

At the moment, Video Hoarder is a free to use, source-available but not free
to use software. This means while everyone is welcome to use the software,
and look at to the source code, the copyright for the software and source rests
with me, the author.

Because I don't want to ask contributors to transfer rights to me, **I'm not
at the moment, accepting pull-requests**.

You are of course free to submit issues. Both **bug-reports and issues are
welcome**.
